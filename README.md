# Amazon-Sales-Data-Analysis
The dataset under examination provides a granular view of Amazon sales operations across India for the fiscal years 2013 and 2014. Comprising 10,000 unique transaction records, the data encompasses a multi-dimensional matrix including temporal (Date, Day), personnel (SalesRep), inventory (Product, Price, Units), and geographic attributes.
# Key Analytical Pillars:
Temporal Dynamics: Sales distribution is remarkably consistent across the week, with a slight peak during the weekends (Sunday at ₹1.52M), indicating a consumer base that remains active throughout the week. Seasonality analysis shows high engagement in January (Avg ₹1,234/sale) and October (Avg ₹1,129/sale), likely correlating with New Year and festive demand cycles in the Indian market.

Product Portfolio Elasticity: The correlation between Price and Units Sold (0.0042) is negligible, suggesting that sales volume is driven by brand loyalty and product category demand rather than price sensitivity. This implies that the current product mix (confectionery and treats) acts as an "impulse buy" or "staple treat" where minor price fluctuations do not significantly deter purchase intent.

Growth Trajectories: While the overall revenue growth was modest (3.3% YoY), specific product segments showed exceptional performance. Nestle Rowntree Screamers led the growth charts with a 36.4% YoY surge, indicating a successful penetration or trending popularity of that specific SKU.

Operational Performance (KPIs): The business achieved 81.3% of its Revenue Target (₹10.2M of ₹12.6M) and 91.7% of its Volume Target (33.9k of 36.9k units). The higher achievement in volume versus revenue points to a "Low Margin-High Volume" trap, where the sales team is moving stock but not necessarily the high-value items required to hit financial benchmarks.
# Final Conclusion
The 2013-2014 performance period characterizes a stable, mature sales operation that excels in volume throughput but faces challenges in meeting aggressive revenue growth targets.
# Core Takeaways:
Regional Concentration Risk: With the North and West regions accounting for nearly two-thirds of total revenue, the business is highly dependent on a few urban clusters (notably Delhi and Mumbai/Pune). The South and East regions represent untapped potential with significant headroom for expansion.

Strategic Portfolio Shift: The decline in core legacy products like Nestle Rowntree Fruit Pastil (-9.9%) and Nestle Rolo Potz (-7.7%) suggests a shift in consumer taste. Conversely, the high growth in newer or niche categories (Screamers, Nobbly Bobbly) identifies a clear path for future product investment.

The "Target Gap": To bridge the 18.7% revenue deficit, the strategy must pivot from purely volume-based sales to a Value-Up approach. This involves upselling premium SKUs (like Nestle Fab and Smarties) and optimizing regional logistics to reduce the cost of sale in lower-performing zones.
# Final Outlook
The business possesses a robust operational foundation and a highly capable salesforce. By diversifying regional focus and aggressively backing the high-growth product categories identified in 2014, the organization is well-positioned to achieve its future targets and improve overall profitability.
